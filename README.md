# Heating Schedule for Homey
With this app you can control your thermostats and schedule several timings.<br />
After installation, it shows a scheduling mask for each zone with attached thermostats.<br />
<br />
For every zone you can enable the heating schedule, if one zone isn't enabled, it automatically inherits the schedule from the parent zone (if enabled).
<br />
For basic usage you don't need any flows, it works standalone once the schedule for a zone was enabled.
